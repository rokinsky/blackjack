# Blackjack Game

This is a simple Blackjack game written in pure JavaScript, with zero configuration.
It is a European version with the No-Hole-Card rule.
It is perfect for anyone who wants to learn how to create their own Blackjack game without any programming knowledge.

## Getting Started

To start the game, simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser. 
The game should load automatically, and you can start playing right away.

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to get a hand total of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over.
The game is played against a dealer, who deals a card to themselves, and two cards to the player.

The player can choose to hit (receive another card) or stand (keep their current hand) until they decide to stand, or they exceed 21, in which case they lose the game.

The dealer must hit until their hand total is at least 17.
If the dealer exceeds 21, the player wins.
If the dealer's hand total is greater than the player's without exceeding 21, the dealer wins.
If the player's hand total is greater than the dealer's without exceeding 21, the player wins.

There are no bets, doubles and splits.
